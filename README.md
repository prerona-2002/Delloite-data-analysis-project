‚úÖ # Task 1: Telemetry Data Breakdown Analysis ‚Äì Daikibo Industrials
Overview:
Analyzed unified telemetry data collected over a month (May 2021) from four Daikibo manufacturing factories located in Tokyo, Osaka, Berlin, and Shenzhen. Each site operated 9 types of machines sending data every 10 minutes.

Objectives:

Identify the factory location with the most machine failures.

Determine the specific machine type that broke down most frequently at that location.

Findings:

üîß Factory with most breakdowns: Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)

üí• Most frequently broken machine: Laser Welder (480 breakdowns)

Tools Used:

Tableau for dashboard development

Excel for data classification

JSON data parsing for telemetry insights

Impact:
Enabled Daikibo to localize high-risk operations and prioritize maintenance for specific machine types, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and reducing downtime.

‚úÖ #Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Assessment ‚Äì Daikibo Industrials
Overview:
Assessed internal salary data across Daikibo‚Äôs factories to measure and classify levels of gender pay equality using a standardized ‚ÄúEquality Score‚Äù algorithm provided by the Forensic Tech team.

Objective:

Classify job roles into defined equality categories based on the score:

Fair (¬±10)

Unfair (<-10 and >10)

Highly Discriminative (<-20 and >20)

Actions Taken:

Created an additional column: Equality Class

Applied logical classification rules to determine fairness level for each job role

Tools Used:

Microsoft Excel for formula-based classification

Data cleansing and enrichment for clarity and auditability

Impact:
Delivered a structured and visualized summary of pay fairness across roles and locations, helping Daikibo address gender-based pay disparities and plan corrective HR measures.
